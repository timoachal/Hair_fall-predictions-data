# Hair Fall Prediction Using XGBoost in R

This repository contains an end-to-end workflow for predicting hair fall using the [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) algorithm within the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework in R. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## Project Overview

Hair fall is a common concern influenced by multiple factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and health conditions. This project leverages machine learning—specifically, the XGBoost algorithm—to predict the likelihood or extent of hair fall based on various input features.

The analysis is performed in R using the tidymodels ecosystem, which streamlines data splitting, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

- R (>= 4.0.0)
- [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/)
- [xgboost](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xgboost)
- [readr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr)
- [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)
- [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2)

Install the required packages in R:

```r
install.packages(c("tidymodels", "xgboost", "readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
```

## Data

- The dataset should contain relevant features associated with hair fall (e.g., age, gender, stress levels, diet, medical history, etc.).
- Ensure your data is stored in a CSV or similar structured format.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, missing values, and feature relationships.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using `initial_split()` from `rsample`.

3. **Model Specification**  
   - Define the XGBoost model using `boost_tree()` from `parsnip`.
   - Set the mode to "regression" or "classification" as per the target variable.

4. **Workflow Creation**  
   - Set up a `workflow()` to bundle preprocessing and modeling steps.

5. **Model Training**  
   - Fit the model on the training data using `fit()`.

6. **Evaluation**  
   - Make predictions on the test set.
   - Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics (e.g., RMSE for regression).

7. **Prediction**  
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data.

## Usage

Below is a simplified example. Replace `"hair_fall_data.csv"` with your data file.

```r
library(tidymodels)
library(xgboost)

# 1. Load data
data <- readr::read_csv("hair_fall_data.csv")

# 2. Split data
set.seed(123)
split <- initial_split(data, prop = 0.8)
train <- training(split)
test <- testing(split)

# 3. Preprocessing
rec <- recipe(HairFall ~ ., data = train) %>%
  step_impute_median(all_numeric_predictors()) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal())

# 4. Model specification
xgb_spec <- boost_tree(
  trees = 1000,
  tree_depth = 6,
  learn_rate = 0.01
) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("regression") # or "classification"

# 5. Workflow
wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  add_model(xgb_spec)

# 6. Train model
xgb_fit <- wf %>% fit(data = train)

# 7. Evaluate
preds <- predict(xgb_fit, test) %>%
  bind_cols(test)

metrics <- yardstick::metrics(preds, truth = HairFall, estimate = .pred)
print(metrics)
```

## Results

- The output includes model performance metrics for the prediction of hair fall.
- Visualization of feature importance and residual analysis can be added for interpretability.
